Implementation of Cached Flutter Engine for multiple routes
Native android source code which demonstrate the implementation of cached flutter engine. Using new flutter engine everytime to route for flutter module have
impact on app performance and takes some times to initiate and load the flutter part of the application. For better performance either warm-up the flutter engine
before using it or use cache flutter engine which can be initialized in the application class and can be used later to route on multiple or similar route(s).
